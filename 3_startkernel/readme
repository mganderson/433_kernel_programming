Note: the modified files that were actually used for this assignment 
are those in modified_kernel_files_4.9.54.  Initially, I had attempted 
to compile the 4.12.14 kernel (from a system that had been running 
Mint using kernel 4.8.x) and, while compilation would complete 
successfully, the system would not boot after selecting the new kernel 
version in the GRUB menu.

I was able to successfully modify and compile the 4.9.54 kernel.

The functions (and the files) that were modified are as follows:

setup_arch(&command_line)
In /arch/x86/kernel/setup.c

setup_command_line(command_line)
In /init/main.c

mm_init()
In /init/main.c

init_timers()
In /kernel/time/timer.c 

pidhash_init()
In /kernel/pid.c
